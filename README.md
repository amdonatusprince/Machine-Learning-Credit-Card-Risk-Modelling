# Machine-Learning-Credit-Card-Risk-Modelling

The German Credit data set contains observations on 30 variables for 1000 past applicants for credit.
Each applicant was rated as “good credit” (700 cases) or “bad credit” (300 cases).
New applicants for credit can also be evaluated on these 30 "predictor" variables.

We want to develop a credit-scoring rule that can be used to determine if a new applicant is a good credit risk or a bad credit risk, based on values for one or more of the predictor variables.
